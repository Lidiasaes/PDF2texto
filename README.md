# PDF2texto

Welcome to PDF2TEXTO,

This is an open source project to deploy a webpage, upload a pdf file and download their .txt file content.
It works well for any selectable text pdf document. It does not work for OCR or similar pdf documents. 


How to use it? 
Copy the project in a folder and use the following commands in Windows:
cd to your folder
install requirements 
python -m streamlit run app.py

------------------------------
I used [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqgUkExPvLY) as first steps for building the website with Streamlit.
