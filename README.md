#  PDF2texto

Welcome to PDF2TEXTO,

This is an open source project to deploy a webpage, upload a pdf file and download their .txt file content.
There are 2 versions:

* [PDF2texto.v.1](https://pdf2texto.streamlit.app/): only works for selectable text.
* [PDF2texto.v.2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1b5Vaa88WOSMKqvIBGRtgVcZmquNhv_eH?usp=sharing): works for any type of pdf file (OCR implemented). 


------------------------------
I used [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqgUkExPvLY) as first steps for building the website with Streamlit.
