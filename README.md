#  PDF2texto :sparkles:

Welcome to **PDF2TEXTO**:sparkles:,

This is an open source project to deploy a webpage, upload a pdf file and download their .txt file content. 

There are 2 versions available:

* [PDF2texto.v.1](https://pdf2texto.streamlit.app/): only works for selectable text.
* [PDF2texto.v.2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1b5Vaa88WOSMKqvIBGRtgVcZmquNhv_eH?usp=sharing): works for any type of pdf file (OCR implemented).


**How to use it?**
1. Run the Colaboratory notebook cell by cell.
2. The last cell will return an output similar to this one:
   
> [!NOTE]
>You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
> 
>Local URL: http://localhost:9012

>Network URL: http://123.45.6.78:9012

> 
> 
>npx: installed 22 in 2.441s

>your url is: https://nice-forks-start.loca.lt

3. In 'External URL', copy the number appearing between https and the port. In this example: 12.345.678.904
4. Click in 'your url is:'. It will pop up a new window.
5. Paste the number you copied in step 3. Click 'Submit'. It will start running :sparkles::sparkles::sparkles:.
